This document is the API specification for the <a

<p>
The following picture shows the overall structure of processing device announce messages:
<p>

<p>
In general, processing announce messages is a chain of several filters and
transformers. Because the connection between all blocks is a
Observer/Observable interface, you can attach an arbitrary amount of
inputs to outputs.
<p>
The <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/AnnounceReceiver.html">AnnounceReceiver</a>
receives announce multicast messages, the AnnounceDeserializer parses
the JSON messages into <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/Announce.html">Java objects</a>. All
<a href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/filter/Filter.html">Filter</a> objects are instantiated
with a specific <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/filter/Matcher.html">Matcher</a>
object, currently a <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/filter/FamilytypeMatch.html">family
type matcher</a>, a <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/filter/UUIDMatch.html">UUID
matcher</a> and <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/filter/ServicetypeMatch.html">service
type matcher</a> are implemented. The <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/filter/Filter.html">Filter</a> objects let
pass only those <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/Announce.html">Announce</a> objects
with respect to the <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/filter/Matcher.html">Matcher</a>. The
<a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/DeviceMonitor.html">DeviceMonitor</a>
monitors the expiration key in <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/Announce.html">Announce</a> messages and
provides the concept of events if a <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/NewDeviceEvent.html">new device</a>
was discovered, a <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/LostDeviceEvent.html">device
was lost</a> (didn't sent announces during the expiration time) or if <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/UpdateDeviceEvent.html">some
information changed</a> in the <a
href="com/hbm/devices/scan/announce/Announce.html">Announce</a> (for instance the IP addresses or
some services).
<p>
It should noted that the whole is completly event driven, no polling is
involved. 
<p>
Please be aware that the whole package is NOT thread safe, so users of
this package must ensure thread safety on their own in a multi-threaded
environment.
