This document is the API specification for the <a

<p>
The following picture shows the overall structure of processing device announce messages:
<p>

<p>
In general processing announce messages is a chain of several filters an
transformers. Because the connection between all blocks is a
Observer/Observable interface, you can attach an arbitrary amount of
inputs to outputs.
<p>
The AnnounceReceiver receive announce multicast messages, the
AnnounceDeserializer parses the JSON messages into Java objects. All
Filter object are instantiated with a specific Matcher object, currently
a family type matcher, a UUID matcher and service type matcher are
implemented. The Filter object let pass only those Announce objects
with respect to the Matcher. The DeviceMonitor monitors the expiration
key in Announce messages and provides the concept of events if a new
device was discovered, a device was lost (didn't sent announces during
the expiration time) or if some information changed in the Announce (for
instance the IP addresses or some services).
<p>
It should noted that the whole is completly event driven, no polling is
involved. 
<p>
Please be aware that the whole package is NOT thread safe, so users of
this package must ensure thread safety on their own in a multi-threaded
environment.
